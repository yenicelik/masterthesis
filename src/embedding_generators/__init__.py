"""
    Includes any classes and wrappers which generate embeddings based on
    - static embeddings (loaded word2vec)
    - dynamic embeddings (generated through language models like ELMo, BERT)

    I could possibly make a test-benchmark between using different embeddings for matching
    (using Optimal Transport perhaps..?)

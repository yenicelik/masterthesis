Rough Cut:
- [] Background: BERT
- [] Background: GPT (minimal)
- [] Related Work: Chinese Whispers & EGO clustering

Final Cut:
- [] Understanding Subspace BERT: Separability
- [] Understanding Subspace BERT: Clusterability Results Qualitative + Quantitative
- [] Understanding Subspace BERT: Correlation PoS Results (short)
- [] Exploiting Subspace BERnie: 

Not urgent:
- [] Related Work: Sweep through all gdocs, and record most interesting papers here (final step, really)

Experiments todo: 
- [] Clustering based on the learned space (siamese network)

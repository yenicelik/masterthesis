We repeat this procedure for the most 20'000 most frequent words which consist of a single token (i.e. are not split up into further subtokens when the tokenizer is applied). We show that although the variance is relatively high, especially if only few WordNet classes are present, there is a correlation between the number of WordNet classes and the variance of sampled BERT context embeddings. The right and top distributions show histograms of how occurrent the variance and WordNet classes are respectively.

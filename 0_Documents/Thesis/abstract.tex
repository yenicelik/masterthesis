Write a summary of the whole thing. Make 
sure it fits in one page. 

How can we arrive at meaning embeddings?
Compared to context-embeddings, these should encode meaning better and exclusively.

Better represent what a computer means, can be used for interpretability, downstream tasks, better unbiased embeddings which do not entail sentiment but meaning only with the words.

21; [CLS] Starting this month, the central bank will publish its economic forecasts four times a year rather than just twice. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Markets will be paying close attention to what ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet says about how the central bank plans to ward off more disruption from U.S. subprime credit woes and the dollar, which has weakened since the U.S. Federal Reserve made a larger-than-expected rate cut. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] But Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress' Joint Economic Committee last week that the central bank believes that risks are roughly balanced at the current time between inflation and weaker growth, a comment that was viewed as a signal to markets not to count on further rate cuts. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Had the central bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged, the stock markets would most likely have plunged into a panic — exactly what Fed officials wanted to avoid. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Bernanke told Congress' Joint Economic Committee that the central bank is watching developments closely, but gave no signal that it's prepared at the current time to cut interest rates even further. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] On Wednesday, the central bank made available £10 billion, or $19.9 billion, lent for three months, into a banking system that has been parched for cash since early August, when a spiraling credit crisis emanating from the United States mortgage market led to a drying up of liquidity. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Many investors expect the central bank to trim rates further this year, but there is debate over whether the reductions will come at the Fed meeting Oct. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Despite rapidly rising oil and food prices, the central bank has apparently concluded that raising borrowing costs at a time when many large banks are still reeling from losses incurred through bets on mortgage-backed securities would be too dangerous. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] A Chinese central bank vice director, Xu Jian, said the dollar was “losing its status as the world currency,” according to Bloomberg News. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Many investors expect the central bank to trim rates further this year, but there is debate over whether another reduction might come at the Fed meeting Oct. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] A Federal Reserve governor warned today that another interest rate cut would probably offer few benefits to the economy, an explicit hint that the central bank plans to hold rates steady at its meeting next month. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] World Bank officials could not say whether the bank would turn to these institutions to help ease payments for the projects in Iran. [SEP]

21; [CLS] Battling to restrain growth in money supply and inflation, the central bank said it would lift the proportion of deposits that commercial banks must keep in reserve by 0.5 percentage point to a record high of 13.5 percent. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] After the Fed’s half-point reduction in September, most investors expect the central bank to deliver a quarter-point cut at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] China’s central bank has been buying foreign currency, mainly dollars, at a pace of $1 billion a day so as to slow the rise of its currency. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] The positive trade figures came a week ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates and may buttress hope that spillover from crises in the housing and credit markets is limited and the central bank needs to lower the benchmark federal funds rate by only a quarter of a percentage point, Mr. Kubarych added. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] He has argued for years that a central bank ought to announce an official “inflation target” that would be a basis for Fed policy. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] The central bank is amassing $20 billion to $30 billion in dollar reserves each month to keep a lid on the yuan. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] A Chinese central bank vice director, Xu Jian, said the dollar was “losing its status as the world currency,” according to Bloomberg News. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] When Northern Rock’s mortgages and mortgage-related securities were unable to be sold because of tight credit markets, the central bank had to act, he said. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] The disappointing report solidified sentiment among investors who bet on the Fed’s actions that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter-point next week. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] This month the central bank took the unusual step of raising interest rates in an election campaign, saying that it was trying to curb inflation. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] It has fewer than two dozen employees, mainly people who have transferred from China’s central bank and have little familiarity with equity investments. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said on Friday that the central bank was ready to act if the turmoil in credit markets threatened to undermine the overall economy. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] As the central bank has spent foreign currency reserves acquiring large stakes in the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the China Construction Bank over the last three years, it has parked those stakes in the Central Huijin Investment Company. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] 20 — The Federal Reserve expects economic growth to slow sharply next year, and policy makers there are worried that even this forecast may prove too optimistic, according to an assessment that the central bank released on Tuesday. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] A Chinese central bank vice director, Xu Jian, said the dollar was “losing its status as the world currency,” according to Bloomberg News. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] The central bank is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point in response to widespread concerns about the lagging housing market and a credit squeeze. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Mr. Greenspan, who ran the central bank for more than 18 years, left in 2006. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Analysts said BOJ Governor Toshihiko Fukui was likely to repeat that the central bank will raise rates gradually at a news conference on Tuesday following a two-day policy meeting. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] But Mr. Yardeni said the yen could level off — or even reverse course — unless Japan’s central bank raised the country’s razor-thin interest rates. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Chile’s inflation rate unexpectedly rose 1.1 percent in September, the third consecutive month of increases, raising analysts’ expectations that the central bank will raise interest rates next week. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Such a view, which Bernanke repeated on Thursday, will likely mean that the central bank plans no further interest rate cuts. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Furthermore, the central bank must walk a narrow line between keeping investors calm and acknowledging the problems out there — particularly for the banks and brokerages that could see more big losses if portions of the credit market, like asset-backed commercial paper, don’t improve. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Mr. Sarkozy has even suggested that the central bank follow the Federal Reserve’s surprise cut in interest rates last month. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Mr. Bernanke, a leading expert on monetary policy at Princeton University before he came to Washington, argued that a central bank needed to be more open, more predictable and more accountable in its decision-making. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] The U.S. central bank reduced interest rates by a cumulative three-quarters of a percentage point at those two meetings to buffer the economy from the shocks of a rise in mortgage defaults and credit market disruptions. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Long-term interest rates, which determine mortgage rates, rose slightly before the central bank began raising the overnight rate in June 2004. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] They responded to the latest growth figures by sending the Shanghai stock market down 4.8 percent on Thursday, on fears that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates to limit inflation. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Against that backdrop, Bernanke said the central bank will be closely watching the economy's vital signs in determining the Fed's next move. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] The price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy indicates that the central bank will probably cut the benchmark rate, now 5.25 percent, to 4.5 percent by the end of the year. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] In 1991, Lawrence Summers — then the World Bank’s chief economist and later Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary — wrote a memo suggesting that the bank should encourage the world’s dirty industries to move to developing countries. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] A recent investment bank report showed that loans made to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit this year had higher default rates than similar loans in 2006 did at the same time in their lives. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] The Chinese central bank said yesterday that it was moving to standardize disclosure of all asset-backed securities as it increases its own market for the financial instruments. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] 18 — The Bank of England on Tuesday doubled the amount of emergency loans made available to British banks caught short in the global credit squeeze — curbing a surge in overnight borrowing costs but fueling criticism that the bank governor was reversing his own policy against bailouts. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Just a day before Bernanke's speech, the Fed's No. 2 official suggested the central bank may be inclined to slice rates again because of Wall Street's turbulence and the worsening problems in housing and in credit markets. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] They responded to the latest growth figures by sending the Shanghai stock market down 4.8 percent on Thursday, on fears that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates to limit inflation. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] A Federal Reserve governor, Kevin M. Warsh, said yesterday that the central bank should be “extremely wary” of protecting banks or investors from losses resulting from the sell-off in credit markets. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Although the central bank appeared relatively unconcerned about the dollar’s high level in its rate announcement, the currency did give it leeway for its interest rate cut. [SEP]

21; [CLS] 18 meeting, when the central bank lowered the target federal funds rate by a larger-than-expected half percentage point. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Investors had reason to rally: The central bank simultaneously loosened the money supply and suggested that strains on the financial markets -- and economy -- have eased. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] In a withering evaluation of the World Bank’s record on African agriculture, the bank’s own internal watchdog concluded in October not only that the removal of subsidies had led to exorbitant fertilizer prices in African countries, but that the bank itself had often failed to recognize that improving Africa’s declining soil quality was essential to lifting food production. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Wall Street widely expects the central bank will again lower rates after its half-point cut in September. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] “Most participants viewed the risks to their G.D.P. projections as weighted to the downside,” the central bank said in its summary of the last policy meeting. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] Rising inflation could prevent the central bank from cutting rates further this year. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] In a statement accompanying its decision, the central bank warned that “some inflation risks remain” and played down risks of a possible recession. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve will begin issuing its economic forecasts more often and in more detail to lift some of the mystery surrounding the central bank and improve communications with Wall Street and Main Street, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke announced Wednesday. [SEP] 
21; [CLS] A Federal Reserve governor said yesterday that another interest rate cut would probably offer few additional benefits to the economy, a hint that the central bank plans to hold rates steady at its meeting next month. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Interest rates are determined by the board of directors of the bank with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration . [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Revenue fell 12 percent to $15.93 billion, the bank said. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Bank of America said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings dropped 32 percent, badly hurt by a huge spike in consumer credit costs and the poor performance of its investment bank unit that has clamored for Wall Street’s respect. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank has raised its loss provisions in recent quarters to cover increasing defaults on mortgages and home equity products. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Its Hong Kong shares were up 0.5 percent at HK$6.23 on Tuesday. -- Industrial & Commercial Bank of China bought 90 percent of PT Bank Halim Indonesia last December. -- Bank of China paid $965 million last December for Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise Pte Ltd. -- In July, China Development Bank, which lends at the direction of the government, bought a 3.1 percent stake in Barclays Plc for 2.2 billion euros ($3.1 billion). -- China Minsheng Banking Corp said this month it will buy 9.9 percent of San Francisco-based UCBH Holdings for more than $200 million in the first investment by a mainland Chinese commercial bank in a U.S. bank. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Helping propel the bank to the top of the list was its advisory work on deals such as Royal Bank of Scotland’s $95 billion acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro, the biggest banking takeover in history; the $48 billion buyout of Canadian telecom giant BCE; and the $44 billion takeover of Texas power company TXU by buyout shops and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG Capital. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Net income for the fifth-largest U.S. bank rose to $2.28 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $2.19 billion, or 64 cents, a year earlier. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Even there, the bank felt pain from the debt markets, as lower fees from fixed-income underwriting cut into higher revenues from its financial advisory work. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank bet heavily that thousands of buyers, many hoping to turn a quick profit, would snap them up. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The fifth-largest U.S. bank announced it would take a $1.4 billion charge in the fourth quarter for mortgage losses. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Merrill’s former chief executive, E. Stanley O’Neal, was forced to resign two week ago after announcing an $8.4 billion write-down and approaching a rival bank to discuss a merger. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank trimmed its forecast for European growth next year to 2 percent, from 2.3 percent, despite what it characterized as a “resilient” global economy. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank bought two new but vacant skyscrapers in the late 1980s at the north end of Times Square and only blocks from Rockefeller Center. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank will cut 650 jobs in all departments from its work force of about 15,500. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] In its monthly statement, the bank did drop a reference to interest rates being “on the accommodative side,” a sign that it has finished tightening credit. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Mr. Zoellick said the bank was going only where the private banks were not ready to go. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] According to the indictment, Mr. Roth helped the contributors get loans from a Los Angeles branch of the bank so their money would be available to them in the United States. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Like its crosstown competitor, Bank of America, its investment bank has suffered heavy losses. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank said it expected to write off $1 billion in 2008 and 2009. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Its capital position could be challenged if the bank must bring the assets held by such off-the-balance-sheet funds back onto its balance sheet. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank also said it would delay repurchases of its shares. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Usually, Gaza’s bank branches send vans to the Erez crossing, on the Gaza-Israel border, to fill up with currency. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] As a result, the bank will contribute $3.5 billion from its own income to the cause of the poorest countries, which generally get loans that involve little or no interest. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] This sum is more than double the amount the bank itself contributed to the last round of aid for the poor. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank would not comment on the lawsuit. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Some suggest that the plan is a Citigroup bailout, which the bank denies and has now secured temporary funding. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] In the case of Acxiom, Bank of America told its private equity clients that it had refused to pay the breakup fee because it was worried it could set a precedent for future deals and could expose the bank to allegations that it had intentionally damaged a business relationship — known as tortious interference — according to people briefed on the negotiations. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Problems began last spring when the bank disclosed that it had overestimated its profit in some derivatives contracts by 630 million kronor, or $97 million, from 2005 to 2007. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Bank of America’s investment bank has lobbied hard to win Wall Street’s respect. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Investors who bet on the Fed’s actions appeared to take the auction as a sign the bank would be less likely to lower interest rates at its next meeting in January. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank estimated that foreign investors own at least $600 billion worth of American corporate asset-backed securities, or 28 percent of the total market for such investments. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] China Merchants is the first Chinese bank to be allowed to open a branch in the United States in two decades, Mr. Cohen said. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Here in Malawi, bank officials say they generally support Malawi’s policy, though they criticize the government for not having a strategy to eventually end the subsidies, question whether its 2007 corn production estimates are inflated and say there is still a lot of room for improvement in how the subsidy is carried out. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The statement spurred concern that the government guarantee of Northern Rock’s deposits, and fading hopes that the bank would find a buyer, could lead to eventual taxpayer losses of $100 billion or more, potentially the worst blow of its kind to any British government in decades. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The executive, Richard A. Stuckey Jr., who helped dismantle the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 after its collapse threatened financial markets, will lead a unit responsible for untangling the bank’s $43 billion in mortgage-backed securities, the bank said yesterday. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank relies on capital markets rather than deposits for new home loans and was one of the hardest hit by rising credit costs, forcing it to seek emergency credit from the Bank of England. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] But Wednesday, the bank announced that John A. Thain, the chief of NYSE Euronext and a former Goldman Sachs executive, would take the crown. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Bank of America said yesterday that its head of global structured products left on Friday, a day after the bank reported a poor quarter for its corporate and investment banking unit. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] A Wells Fargo spokesman, Kevin Waetke, said the bank would not comment on the details of the case as the bank is appealing a motion by Mr. Jones for sanctions. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The action represents a renewed effort by the bank to calm a lending system that had showed signs of returning to normal recently but now appears nearly as nervous as during the summer days when the global credit turmoil began. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Shares of Northern Rock rose 5.9 pence to £2.7 in London, giving the bank a market value of about £1.35 billion ($2.7 billion). [SEP] 
123; [CLS] “The banks have not given any reason for these restrictions yet,” he said, adding that a trade delegation was in Beijing to discuss the restriction and that Iran’s central bank was also negotiating with the Chinese. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The Federal Reserve Board has approved the application by the sixth-largest Chinese bank to open an office in New York, its first branch in the United States. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] That contrast has allowed Mr. Rubin to float above the fray, even as he has helped guide the bank during Mr. Prince’s tumultuous tenure. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank chosen for the custodian assignment would oversee the financial record-keeping and other back-office operations for the new fund. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank also signed a cease-and-desist order in which it agreed to stop intermingling the personal interests of its officials and their relatives with its operations. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Investors fear the bank will be forced to write down the value of assets beyond the $8.4 billion it wrote down in the third quarter, adding to concerns about a tightening credit market. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The scale of the effort left many market analysts puzzled as to why the bank stepped in so forcefully. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Though the bank took the same approach when the credit crisis erupted in August, the scale of the intervention at that time — about 95 billion euros in overnight funds — was much smaller. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] In a statement released before the temporary arrangement was announced, the Canadian bank said there was a “reasonably high probability” that it would have to write down mortgage securities it had insured with ACA, suggesting that the charge could total up to $2 billion. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] After weighing that balance, many economists predicted that the bank would not cut its rate. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Under Mr. O’Neal, the bank aggressively entered into new and risker businesses, including underwriting collateralized debt obligations, originating subprime loans and expanding its proprietary trading operations. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Still, the bank has to preserve its options in case the outlook for inflation worsens — an entirely plausible event given escalating oil and commodity prices — while bearing in mind that higher interest rates could worsen the credit squeeze and hurt manufacturers and other companies. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The cash shortage followed a decision by Israeli commercial banks to halt all business transactions with Palestinian bank branches in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] According to information circulating among members of the Security Council, the bank has all but ceased to function. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The losses and write-downs prompted the Swiss bank on Tuesday to report a loss for the third quarter, its first in nearly five years. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] A Wachovia spokeswoman, Christy Phillips-Brown, said the bank had received the payment and had not decided whether the suit, filed in United States District Court in New York, would be dropped. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Less well understood, the bank also oversees $55 billion in readily tradable assets in its own portfolio and those of governments and groups that have asked the bank to manage their assets. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] “You’re attacking a bank at a time when factors are quite supportive of it,” Mr. Hudson said. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] During the past two days, however, bank representatives and senior Treasury Department officials began to discuss whether to abandon the plan. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] In fact, specialists on boardroom protocol say that on the face of it, a brief conversation with a fellow chief executive at a rival bank is by no means a firing offense. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] “The most important recommendation is that anticorruption efforts are a vital function of the bank and need to be incorporated into everything we do,” he said. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] While HSBC may have found a way to bolster investor confidence in its SIVs, some bank executives are still concerned about additional write-downs, especially after HSBC said earlier this month that losses in the housing market were spreading to credit card and other consumer loans, forcing it to set aside $3.4 billion, more than it had forecast four months earlier. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank on Friday downgraded its profit outlook for this year and next year. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] It has been heavily criticized by the opposition and some investors for mishandling the situation and being too slow to assure clients their deposits were safe, and then creating a “moral hazard” by guaranteeing all deposits of a bank whose business model was too reliant on the credit markets. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank became sole custodian of the other two, Dues and the small Robert U. and Mabel O. Lipscomb Foundation. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Some suggest that the plan is a Citigroup bailout, which the bank denies. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Each bank will put up an unspecified amount of its own capital into the fund, and other banks from around the world are expected to join the consortium in the coming weeks. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank announced earlier this month that it expected to write down $5 billion because of losses in its fixed-income unit. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] In the debut of an effort to describe its internal thinking more openly, the Fed unveiled a detailed forecast that summarizes the views as well as the disagreements among the Fed’s governors and regional bank presidents. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] “When we hit the Fourth of July weekend, and those first couple of deals had problems, the world woke up to the fact that there is a whole lot more of it coming,” a senior executive at a major bank said. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank is scheduled to release its third-quarter results on Oct. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Professor Easterly, a research economist at the bank for more than a decade, likened the evaluation to saying Coca-Cola is bad at making its signature soft drink. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank said it held 60 billion francs ($51.62 billion) worth of buyout -- or leverage -- loans in the third quarter, up from 48 billion francs in the previous quarter. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] That has led to political pressure on the bank as well as a request from auto-parts makers to the government for 400 million Canadian dollars in emergency financing. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Analysts expected the ECB to hold firm, but the focus will now look toward when the bank does actually start moving, said Holger Schmieding, Bank of America's chief European economist. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Bank of America announced a shake-up of its investment bank last night, cutting 3,000 jobs and installing Brian T. Moynihan as its fourth leader in fewer than seven years. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] But Mr. O’Neal retired under pressure this week after an unauthorized merger approach to a rival bank and an $8.4 billion write-down that resulted in an overall loss of $2.3 billion for the quarter. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] “Here’s your most important client, Africa, with its most important sector, agriculture, relevant to the most important goal — people feeding their families — and the bank has been caught with two decades of neglect,” he said. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] In fact, specialists on boardroom protocol say that on the face of it, a brief conversation with a fellow chief executive at a rival bank is by no means a firing offense. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Problems began last spring when the bank disclosed that it had overestimated its profit in some derivatives contracts by 630 million kronor, or $97 million, from 2005 to 2007. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The bank took write-downs of $1.35 billion pretax on the value of funded and unfunded leveraged loans as the market has dried up. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Weighing such benefits as a falloff in school dropout rates and a decline in crime, the bank calculated that every dollar invested in the sistema was reaping about $1.68 in social dividends. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] They might join Mr. Rubin or other high-ranking bank executives as part of a larger committee overseeing the bank. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Mr. Ernst said the bank provides a key competitive advantage in attracting tax clients in the first few weeks of the tax season. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Had this been in place earlier, a bank like IKB would not have been able to use off-balance sheet assets so aggressively, storing up problems for later. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Shares of Northern Rock rose 5.9 pence to £2.7 in London, giving the bank a market value of about £1.35 billion ($2.7 billion). [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Some bank executives and officials from development ministries say the new president has been less than clear in outlining his priorities. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Banks were barred from charging less than 90 percent of the benchmark rates for mortgages previously, while buyers of a second home will be required to pay 40 percent of a property’s value as down payment, up from 30 percent, the bank said. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Usually, Gaza’s bank branches send vans to the Erez crossing, on the Gaza-Israel border, to fill up with currency. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] As a result, Moody's Investors Service cut its debt ratings, putting the largest U.S. bank under renewed pressure to shore up its shrinking capital base. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The government has lent more than £20 billion ($40 billion) over the last two months to secure deposits at Northern Rock, many of them pension savings, and to end the first run on a bank in the country since 1866. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] In a meeting Friday in Manila, the bank’s board approved its biggest single-project loan — $1.1 billion — to finance the start of work next year on a 152-mile stretch of the highway from Hanoi to Lao Cai on the border, the bank said in a statement. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] That is $1.4 billion (960 million euros) more than expected based on first-half trends, and the bank said it was shutting another 260 branches in the U.S. consumer finance division. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Like its crosstown competitor, Bank of America, Wachovia’s investment bank has suffered heavy losses. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] On the face of it, a brief conversation about a possible merger with a fellow chief executive at a rival bank is by no means a firing offense. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] A spokeswoman from Groupe Banque Populaire said the bank would not comment until after Natixis’s third-quarter earnings were announced Thursday. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The Federal Reserve has approved the application by the sixth-largest Chinese bank to open an office in New York, its first branch in the United States. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] He said the bank might be forced to sell assets, issue equity or cut its dividend to shore up precariously low capital levels. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] It also shows the struggle for a bank outside New York to compete against more established Wall Street rivals. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] Analysts say Mr. Rubin must demonstrate his commitment to the job and make sure the bank has no new earnings surprises. [SEP] 
123; [CLS] The news prompted a sell-off in the shares of Northern Rock and other British bank stocks as investors worried about the possibility of similar problems at other institutions, as well as threats to the broader economy. [SEP]
